**[WIP]** A sandbox for ideation and iteration on small electric powertrain designs.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional engineer and this project will not give you real-world accurate numbers, it's meant moreso for understanding changes to your design and giving you ballpark numbers.

See notepad.txt for my latest scratch which is ahead of the actual code.
